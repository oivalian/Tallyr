# Tallyr
**Tallyr** is a word counter that handles multiple documents for a continuous count.

## Use cases
I am a fiction author and I draft my chapters separately. This tool provides a cumulative word count across those files so I don’t have to compile the manuscript just to check progress.

This tool is also useful for:

- Split Reports or Essays
- Academic Research Notes
- Manuscript Tracking
- Editing
- and more ...

## How it works
**_Open File_** supports multi-file selection and will generate a cumulative word count. Additional files can be opened later, and the total will adjust automatically.

**_Reset_** will reset the current counter.
